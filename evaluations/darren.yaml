        remarks: |
          - It looks like you're defining your goals on https://github.com/rickallauigan/dicee
            but they can be better improved. I added a section on your dsu-reports.yaml file for
            you to define your goal specifically, under `meta.goal`.
          - You can improve your DSU report by referencing the github repository link of your dicee app,
            and then you can improve your dicee app repository by linking to the tutorial that 
            you are following.
          - If you are following multiple tutorials, then specify what your goals are for following
            those tutorials. e.g. is the dicee app tutorial supposed to teach state? Is the alarm4u app
            supposed to teach X? That way, your daily reports about those tutorials can also involve you
            writing about what you've learned about (and what struggles you encountered) from those tutorials.

          - Please review dsu-reports.yaml and define your goals. That way, you can always remember what
            you are trying to accomplish with your daily training. Good luck!
